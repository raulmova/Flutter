# Flutter

Projects I've used to learn the basics of the Flutter Framework.

## The projects are the following:

1. **flutter_crash_course** : youtube tutorial to develop a game app about answering yes/no questions.

2. **flutter_app** : Flutter Starter Code.

3. **restaurapp** : youtube tutorial to develop an app that displays restaurants on a certain radius and coordenates. [Key.dart File was deleted for security purposes]. The file has the following structure : 

   -----------------Key.dart-------------------
   	
    ~~~~~~~~

    final String _key = 'YourGoogleMapsAPIKey';

    String get key => _key;
    
    	
    ~~~~~~~~

   
4. **startup_namer** : Flutter tutorial on flutter.io. The app generates random names.

5. **udemy_1** : Just a green rectangle widget.

6. **unitconverter** : Free Udacity Course to learn the basics of Flutter. The final outcome is an unit converter app.
